# MCCSC Salary Spread 2019-2020 


This directory was created to:
* 1) practice creating graphs in Python's Plotly library.
* 2) to create a rough website on Github using a free Bootstrap template.

The data for the Plotly graphs come from MCCSC's (Monroe County Community School Corporation) budget website. 
The graphs provide a visual for the spread and nature of employee salaries and experience.
