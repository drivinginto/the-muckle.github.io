<ul>
This directory was created to:
  <li> 1) practice creating graphs in Python's Plotly library </li>
  <li> 2) to create a rough website on Github using a free Bootstrap template </li>

The data for the Plotly graphs come from MCCSC's (Monroe County Community School Corporation) budget website. 
The graphs provide a visual for the spread and nature of employee salaries and experience.
